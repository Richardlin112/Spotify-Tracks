## Project Description:
Our project analyzes Spotify track data to answer the following 3 major questions:
1. What features make a song more popular on Spotify in general and within its own genre?
2. How well can we predict a song's popularity based on various features of the song?
3. How can we build a system to recommend songs to Spotify users?
